When trying different hyperparameters, please cut a separate validation split (10-20% of total training set size) from your training data to assess generalization importance.

You can also apply regularization, batch normalization, or data augmentation as you see fit. Please show all steps, so we can follow the progression of your improvements to the model. Evaluate your model. You should report training, validation, and test accuracy (all three).\n",
